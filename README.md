# f/manager F256

## Overview

f/manager is a dual-panel file and memory manager for the [Foenix F256jr and F256K retro computers](http://wiki.f256foenix.com/index.php?title=Main_Page). If you do not own a Foenix computer, or if you don't know what one is, this software should have limited interest for you. Go back now before you are sucked into the world of programming and using 8-bit and 16-bit computers as if it was the 1980s. You have been warned. 

If you are a brand new F256 owner, congratulations on your purchase, and welcome to exciting world of retro-computing... without retrobrite!
