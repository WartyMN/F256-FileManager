/* about this class: WB2KFolderObject
 *
 * This handles folders on disk, with FileObject children for any files in the folder
 *
 *** things this class needs to be able to do
 *
 * get a listing of the files in the folder
 * indicate if a passed file object or filepath is a match for something in its list
 * perform actions on all or only-selected files in the folder, using recursion and a function pointer
 * - get total of all file sizes
 * - delete
 * - move
 * - copy
 *
 *** things objects of this class have
 *
 * A list of WB2KFileObjects (potentially empty)
 * count of files in the folder, kept up to date
 * total size, in bytes, of all files in the folder, including files in sub-folders (on request; not kept up to date for performance reasons)
 *
